# ESP8266 Powered Smart-Dehumidifier

Controlling a standard dehumidifier wirelessly with a humidity sensor and
ESP8266. This general premise can be used as a template for any sensor/
appliance combo.

**==== Make sure your dehumidifier is compatible ====**

## Circuit Materials & Assembly

I exclusively used materials I already had lying around. Will other things work?
Very probably yes, although you may need some slight tweaks. If I didn't already
have an ESP8266 lying around from a hackathon, I probably would have used a
Raspberry Pi Pico W.

- ESP8266 (basically a cheap arduino with a wifi module)
- Adafruit SHT31-D Temp & Humidity Sensor
- 400 pin breadboard
- LED and compatible resistor (optional)
